# Test

Run tests, capture results, diagnose every failure, and optionally auto-fix or write new tests.

## Steps

### 1. Discover test setup
- Read `.ccs/conventions.md` for test framework and patterns
- If missing, auto-detect: check `package.json` scripts, config files (`jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`), Glob for test files
- Identify the test runner command

### 2. Determine scope
Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- No arg or `all` → full suite
- File path → tests for that file
- Test name → specific test by pattern
- `--fix` → run and auto-fix failures
- `--write <file>` → write new tests for specified file
- `--coverage` → run with coverage

### 3. Run tests
Execute via Bash with verbose, non-interactive flags. Use appropriate runner for the stack.

### 4. Parse results
Extract: total, passed, failed, skipped, duration. For each failure: test name, file, error message, expected vs actual, stack trace (first 10 lines).

### 5. Diagnose failures
For each failing test:
1. Read the test file and source file
2. Classify: assertion failure, runtime error, missing mock, environment issue, outdated snapshot, timeout, dependency error
3. Determine: is the test wrong or the code wrong?

### 6. Auto-fix (if `--fix`)
- Apply high-confidence fixes, re-run to verify
- If new failures appear, rollback and report
- For medium/low confidence → ask user first

### 7. Write tests (if `--write`)
- Read target source file and `.ccs/conventions.md`
- Identify untested code paths (branches, error cases, edge cases)
- Generate test file following conventions, run to verify

### 8. Log to `.ccs/task.md`
Append using template at `.claude/skills/_ccs/templates/task-template.md`:
- Type: `test`, results summary, failures with root causes, fixes applied, tests written

## Rules
- Always use verbose + non-interactive mode
- Read test file AND source file before diagnosing
- After fix → re-run to confirm no regressions
- Run `/ccs-test` after every `/ccs-build` or `/ccs-fix`

## Refs
- Conventions: `.ccs/conventions.md`
- Task log: `.ccs/task.md`
- Strategy: `.claude/skills/_ccs/references/context-strategies.md`
